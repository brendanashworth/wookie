> wookie is a C web framework - it uses [Joyent's HTTP parser](https://github.com/joyent/http-parser) and the [r3 path dispatcher](https://github.com/c9s/r3). Its focus is on high performance and not reinventing the wheel.

The software is still in development. If you are a contributor, please push your commits. Once the software is fully-functional (and performance tweaked), I will post req / sec from `ab`.

### Development
Check out our [wiki](https://github.com/brendanashworth/wookie/wiki) for info.
